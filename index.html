      <h2>Welcome to Liar's Dice</h2>

      <h5>Instructions:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Five 6-sided dice are used per player with dice cups used for
          concealment
        </li>
        <li>
          Each round, each player rolls their 5 dice, you can check what is
          under your cup by clicking on your cup
        </li>
        <li>
          Turns rotate in a clockwise direction, The first player begins bidding
          announcing any dice face value and the minimum number of dice that the
          player believes are showing that value, under all players cups in the
          game
        </li>
        <li>
          Ones are wild always counting as the dice face of the current bid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each player has 2 choices to make a higher bid, or challenge the
          previous bid by calling liar. Raising the bid means either increasing
          the quantity, or the face value, or both.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the current player challenges the previous bid, all dice are
          revealed. if the bid is valid, the bidder wins. Otherwise, the
          challenger wins.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player who loses a round loses one of their dice. The last player
          to still retain a die (or dice) is the winner. The loser of the last
          round starts the bidding on the next round. If the loser of the last
          round was eliminated, the next player starts the new round.
        </li>
